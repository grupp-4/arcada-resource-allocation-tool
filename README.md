# Arcada Resource Allocation Tool

A web app designed for the staff at [Arcada UAS](https://www.arcada.fi/en "arcada.fi") to more easily be able to allocate their people resources and quickly manage things like:

- who keeps what course?
- who `conducts` what research?
- is this month’s workload evenly distributed?
- is someone doing too many hours per month?

## Special Note

The app was made as a course project in ”Ramverk och webbapplikationer (2019-20)” — a course part of the swedish [Information Technology Bachelor’s degree programme](https://www.arcada.fi/en/bachelor/information-technology "arcada.fi/en/bachelor/information-technology") at [Arcada](https://www.arcada.fi/en "arcada.fi").
